# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

## Project Overview

This project is a web application built with Next.js and integrated with Firebase. Its primary purpose is to provide tools for working with timestamps, including converting timestamps to human-readable dates and calculating the difference between two timestamps.

## Key Features

*   **Timestamp Conversion:** Easily convert Unix timestamps to human-readable date and time formats.
*   **Time Difference Calculation:** Calculate the difference between two timestamps in various units (e.g., seconds, minutes, hours, days).
*   **Current Timestamp Display:** View the current Unix timestamp in real-time.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive design for easy input and display of timestamp information.
*   **Firebase Integration:** Leverages Firebase for potential future features like user authentication or data storage (though not fully implemented in this starter).
